        <p>
            My name is Hiyab Goitom, and I was born in the vibrant city of Mekelle in 1993 E.C. Growing up in this historic city shaped who I am today. 
            I’ve always been curious, passionate, and eager to learn new things, which led me on an incredible educational journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            My interests include exploring technology, connecting with people, and contributing to society through my knowledge and skills. 
            I’m committed to continuous growth and learning.
